Open FPGA loader is used to take the bitstream file and load it over to a board. 
It can be built from source and the online install guide for the tool includes special mac instructions for doing just that; however, 
luckily there is a pre put together homebrew formula for installing openfpga loader which is validated for current Apple Silicon. 
I've gotten it running on a Raspberry Pi before; however, no work on how stable it is in that format.
