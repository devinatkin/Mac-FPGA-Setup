This document provides instructions for setting up and working with FPGA on a Mac. 
The goal behind these instructions is to allow students to complete ENEL 453 labs from an OSx device.
\textbf{THIS IS NOT A SUPPORTED WORKFLOW! 
The course expects you to be using a Windows Machine and the Official Xilinx Toolchain. 
The flow presented here is based on less reliable open source software which TAs are not familiar with.} 
There are other reasons to move to a windows or linux machine, it is an industry standard and you should familiarize yourself with the tools before you have to use them in a production environment. 
That being said I want students who have mistakenly purchased an Apple silicon device to be able to complete the labs on their own machines if it is at all possible. 
Post issues with the install instructions on the documents github and the issues will be cleared once the issue has been resolved or further explained.
